Short Description about my Webpage:

"Personal Profile" is a modern web page designed using HTML(index.html) and CSS(style.css).

The deep grey, white and black color co-ordination in the animations and the button transitions adds a vibrant and professional feel to the web page.
It features 5 important sections that showcases my portfolio and a smooth user experience.

The web page is designed with responsive styling and interactive transitions which ensures dynamic user experience.
It is fully optimized for smaller screens like mobile phones and tablets with a responsive menu making it accessible on all the devices.
